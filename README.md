Hi, I conduct research in quantum computing miscellania. I am also in my last year of high school. Feel free to email me for my resume, or [schedule a call with me](https://cal.com/fractalmachina/professional). conceptually, I am interested in infinite state automata, artificial consciousness, and simulated divinity. you may define those things for yourself. side interests include e2e encryption, and *very occasionally* we do some dabbling in x86 assembly.

I am most active in a professional sense on [misskey forks](https://bytes.programming.dev/@0x42), and I try to keep my software and, uh, shitposting separate (though if you are curious, do feel free to have a chat.)
