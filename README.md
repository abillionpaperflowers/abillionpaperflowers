hi, I conduct research in quantum computing miscellania. I am also 17 years old, in my last year of high school. feel free to email me for my resume, or [schedule a call with me](https://cal.com/fractalmachina/professional). conceptually, I am interested in artificial consciousness, divine simulacra, and rationality. you may define those things for yourself. side interests include e2e encryption, and *very occasionally* we do some dabbling in x86 assembly, not in the public eye. I like FOSS.

I am most active in a professional sense on Misskey forks, but I'm migrating instances at the moment, kind of? Long story.

my opinions are my own and not representative of my employers.

...also my pgp key broke.
