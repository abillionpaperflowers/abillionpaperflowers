Hi, I conduct research in quantum computing miscellania. I am also in my last year of high school. Feel free to email me for my resume, or [schedule a call with me](https://cal.com/fractalmachina/professional). conceptually, I am interested in artificial consciousness, divine simulacra, and rationality. you may define those things for yourself. side interests include e2e encryption, and *very occasionally* we do some dabbling in x86 assembly, not in the public eye. I like FOSS.

I am most active in a professional sense on Misskey forks, but I'm migrating instances at the moment, kind of? Long story.

My opinions are my own and not representative of my employers.
