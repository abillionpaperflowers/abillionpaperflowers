Hi, I conduct research in quantum computing miscellania. I am also in my last year of high school. Feel free to email me for my resume, or [schedule a call with me](https://cal.com/fractalmachina/professional). conceptually, I am interested in artificial consciousness and rationality. you may define those things for yourself. side interests include e2e encryption, and *very occasionally* we do some dabbling in x86 assembly, not in the public eye.

I am most active in a professional sense on [Misskey forks](https://bytes.programming.dev/@0x42), and I try to keep my software and, uh, shitposting separate (though if you are curious, do feel free to have a chat.)

My opinions are my own and not representative of my employers.
