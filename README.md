Hey, I'm abillionshiningstars, better known as "abillionpaperflowers" on Instagram.
I’m interested in visual art, data science, and game development. Overall, I'm just a software enthusiast trying my best.    
Mainly code in Python and C#, learning SwiftUI, Unity, and what would typically be considered "easy front-end stuff".
